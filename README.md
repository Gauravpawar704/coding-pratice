- # C++ Pointers Practice

This repository contains C++ programs focused only on **Pointers**.
These programs demonstrate how pointers work with memory, functions, and values.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Pointer basics  
- Address and dereference operators  
- Call by reference  
- Swapping using pointers  
- Pointer arithmetic  

## 💻 Programs Included
1. Print value and address using pointer  
2. Swap two numbers using pointers  
3. Pointer arithmetic demonstration  
4. Call by reference example  
5. Find largest number using pointers  

## 🎯 Purpose
- Understand memory handling in C++  
- Build strong foundation for DSA  
- Learn real use of pointers  
- Improve low-level programming skills  

## 🛠 Language Used
- C++
